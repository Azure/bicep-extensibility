      summary: Preview a resource create or update operation
      description: |
        Preview a resource creation or update operation by simulating the process.

        Upon successful simulation, the outcome must mirror a resource that has been either created or updated, based on the operation that was previewed. This resulting state should align with what would be ontained from a GET response, as if the genuine create or update operation had been carried out. This includes the inclusion of read-only properties and properties endowed with default values, as well as the exclusion of write-only properties like those containing sensitive information such as passwords and connection strings.

        Should the simulation encounter failure due to inadequate information, the response must detail the errors encountered.

      description: |
        Create or update a resource.
        
        Upon successful operation, the service must add an identifiers property to its response. This property is an object consisting of several sub-properties that, when combined with the resource's type and configuration, create a *globally unique* key for identifying the resource. The structure of the identifiers property is determined by the extension service and is opaque to the template deployment engine.

        If the operation is synchronus or a resource based long-running operation (RELO), the response status code must be 201 Created for nonexistent resource or 200 OK for existing resource.

        If the opeartion is being implemented as a stepwise long-running operation (LRO), the response status code should be 202 Accepted.
