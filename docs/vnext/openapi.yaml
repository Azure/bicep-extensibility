      summary: Preview a resource create or update operation
      description: |
        Preview a resource creation or update operation by simulating the process.

        Upon successful simulation, the outcome must mirror a resource that has been either created or updated, based on the operation that was previewed. This resulting state should align with what would be obtained from a GET response, as if the genuine create or update operation had been carried out. This includes the inclusion of read-only properties and properties endowed with default values, as well as the exclusion of write-only properties like those containing sensitive information such as passwords and connection strings.
        Additionally, the service must provide a configuration ID if a user configuration is received. This property should uniquely identify a deployment control plane and its format is decided by the extension. It is used as a checksum for some resource operations such as deletion.
        A configuration ID is not required as input, however, if one is provided, it will be validated.
        
        Should the simulation encounter failure due to invalid properties, the response must detail the errors encountered.
        
        [TODO 1]: We need to explore strategies for handling ARM template expressions.
          
        [TODO 2]: A mechanism is required for extensions to report properties that cannot be determined during the preview phase, such as a timestamp. One idea is to utilize a placeholder ARM template expression, like `[unknown()]`, for these property values.

      summary: Create or update a resource
      description: |
        Create or update a resource.
        
        Upon successful operation, the service must add an identifiers property to its response. This property is an object consisting of several sub-properties that, when combined with the resource's type and configuration, create a *globally unique* key for identifying the resource. The structure of the identifiers property is determined by the extension service and is opaque to the template deployment engine.
        Additionally, the service must provide a configuration ID if a user configuration is received. This property should uniquely identify a deployment control plane and its format is decided by the extension. It is used as a checksum for some resource operations such as deletion.
        A configuration ID is not required as input, however, if one is provided, it will be validated.
        
        If the operation is synchronous or a resource based long-running operation (RELO), the response status code should be 201 Created for nonexistent resource or 200 OK for existing resource. However, if the extension service cannot determine whether the resource already exists, or if determining this is costly (e.g., requiring an additional query), it is acceptable to return a 200 OK status code.

        If the operation is being implemented as a stepwise long-running operation (LRO), the response status code should be 202 Accepted.
